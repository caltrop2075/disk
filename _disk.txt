disk utilities

disk.sh

here's a utility that I use a LOT!
nice bargraph of the hard drives
if your're a data hoarder like me this is essential
I added it to .bashrc so it runs when a terminal is opened

disk-c.sh

continuous statistics display

disk-sum.sh

a continuation or the previous
this shows a bargraph for all first level directories for all external drives
the $HOME drive has too many directories for this to work well
so I did external drives only that are used for storage
